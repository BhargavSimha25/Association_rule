# Association Rules in Machine Learning

Welcome to the **Association Rules in Machine Learning** repository! This project is designed to help you explore, understand, and implement association rule mining techniques, widely used in data mining and market basket analysis.

## 📚 Overview

Association rule mining is a powerful tool for uncovering hidden patterns and relationships within large datasets. This technique is commonly applied in scenarios like market basket analysis, where it identifies products that frequently appear together in transactions. By understanding these relationships, businesses can optimize product placements, design targeted marketing strategies, and improve customer experiences.

### Key Concepts
- **Antecedent & Consequent:** The "if" (antecedent) and "then" (consequent) relationship in a rule.
- **Support:** Measures how often the items in the rule appear together in the dataset.
- **Confidence:** Indicates the likelihood of the consequent given the antecedent.
- **Lift:** Evaluates the strength of the rule over random occurrence.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
To get started with this project, you’ll need:
- Python 3.x
- Libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `mlxtend`, `scikit-learn`

### Installation
